Today, advancements in computing sector has resulted new ways to compromise users privacy and security.

And it's equally important for users to know and understand how it affects their privacy.

Because your data is your data, and not a part of some Big Data.

On this site, I want to make people understand those things because it's the user who can control his privacy more than any party.

I cover everything right from managing your privacy on social media services to controlling your data on software or internet services.

The articles on this site are not "supported by" nor "against" any party for unbiased content to viewers.
